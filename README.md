#Project Title 
Emma's Recipe Library


#Project Functionality
The project displays a list of recipes. There are five different countries to pick from. The user can pick from multiple meals from each country. There are breakfast and dinner options. A description is presented for each meal. 

#Project Reason
Why its useful, fun, or just why did you pick this project to make?
The project is meant to help organize and inspire different meals for cooking. Hopefully it will inspire the user to explore some new meals. It's mostly for fun, but I enjoy cooking. I like a large variety of food. It can be hard finding new meals to cook. So the purpose is to generate some new options.
